## Personal notes

It has really been a while since i've had to code anything in C++, so it has been quite the challenge, specially at this level. My entire experience with the language has been pretty sparse through college. But regardless of the result (even though i hope it is positive) it has been a great experience.

One of the most challenging things was learning about modern C++. When i first saw the example, it sounded pretty familiar. Pointers, references, etc. like college. But three days into the exam it ocurred to me to google modern practices in c++. And well. Smart pointers were a thing. So I changed everything up to startard and began coding.

The special features are the locked door (kind of) that is locked behind the reward of a quest. And well, the Quests! Big special feature. The great thing about them is how they allowed me to introduce items that were not already in the rooms seemlessly through the rewards. As well as the multiple endings that were very fun to think about and code. 

I'll have to admit, the game is not perfect by all means, there is plenty of hard-coded stuff. But I think the end product is playable, fun and shows at least great effort.

Thank you for the experience,

## Walkthrough

We'll begin by taking the shovel, then going down one level.

take the talisman on the second level.

we then go down 2 levels to the forge and talk to the blacksmith. He will allow us to pick up the pickaxe. He will also give us a quest.

With the pickaxe, we go up a level and "mine copper vein".

Then we go down again and drop the shovel and the copper vein.

The blacksmith will have put a copper pickaxe on our inventory so we can proceed! He will also give us a new quest.

***BAD ENDING 1***
Go down until the bottom.

going down 2 levels, we see a gold vein. We mine the gold vein.

***BAD ENDING 2***
With the gold vein on our inventory, climb back to the surface.

For the true ending, go down from the gold another level and mine the mythril.

Drop the mythril vein on the forge and talk to the blacksmith. He will give us a necklace.

Climb back up to the temple and drop the gold vein. The goddess will be happy and gift us a ring.

With the three acessories, dig down to the bottom and you will have finished the game!
