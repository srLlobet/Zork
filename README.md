## Walkthrough

We'll begin by taking the shovel, then going down one level.

take the talisman on the second level.

we then go down 2 levels to the forge and talk to the blacksmith. He will allow us to pick up the pickaxe. He will also give us a quest.

With the pickaxe, we go up a level and "mine copper vein".

Then we go down again and drop the shovel and the copper vein.

The blacksmith will have put a copper pickaxe on our inventory so we can proceed! He will also give us a new quest.

***BAD ENDING 1***
Go down until the bottom.

going down 2 levels, we see a gold vein. We mine the gold vein.

***BAD ENDING 2***
With the gold vein on our inventory, climb back to the surface.

For the true ending, go down from the gold another level and mine the mythril.

Drop the mythril vein on the forge and talk to the blacksmith. He will give us a necklace.

Climb back up to the temple and drop the gold vein. The goddess will be happy and gift us a ring.

With the three acessories, dig down to the bottom and you will have finished the game!
